When writing website copy:
- Maintain 70% professional / 30% edgy tone ratio
- Always back bold claims with specific metrics (e.g., "+220% conversion", "50+ projects")
- Use provocative language sparingly - only for impact, not constantly
- Focus on client results and ROI rather than criticizing competitors
- Replace crude language with confident, direct statements
- Include social proof (client logos, case studies, testimonials)
- Every service description must include concrete performance metrics
